# Solid Merch

A basic store website for different shades of blue, made using Solidjs. It has a router, and several components that I reuse throughout the site.

This is also my first website that is not made with pure HTML. Thanks to Net Ninja for the Solidjs tutorial.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Please note that you need to have a JSON server running on port 4000, with `data.json` being watched.
4. Run `npm run dev`
